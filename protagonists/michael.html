<div class="descpers">
<p>Michael De Santa is one of the three main characters of Gta5. Born in 1965, probably in the
  <br>Middle West, which would explain why his criminal career took place mainly between North Yankton
  <br>and Carcer City. Raised in a poor and degraded environment, he had an alcoholic father who often
  <br>abused him. He started playing American football on his high school team. He showed great talent
  <br>as a player, appearing in several local newspapers. However, due to his behavioral problems and
  <br>continuing injuries, he was forced to retire. In 1985, at the age of 20, he made his first bank
  <br>robbery in the suburbs of Carcer City, managing to steal $10,000. 
  <br>
  <br>In the same year he was arrested twice. In addition to the robberies, 
  <br>Michael was also a drug smuggler. Despite several arrests,
  <br>Michael has become one of America’s most wanted criminals.
  <br>A few years later he met Trevor Philips and Brad Snider, 
  <br>with whom he formed a team of successful robbers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>Despite the excellent friendship between Michael and Trevor, the latter did not get along with Amanda,
  <br>Michael’s future wife. Together they have two children namely Tracey and Jimmy.
  <br>
  <br>Michael then decided to become more cautious as a criminal,
  <br>causing disagreements with Trevor. In 2004, Michael, Trevor, and Brad organized a robbery at the offices
  <br>of a security transport company in Ludendorff (North Yankton), which had a disastrous outcome.
  <br>Pursued by dozens of cops, the three head for the escape point, where they find an ambush by other cops;
  <br>Brad is killed and Michael is wounded, forcing Trevor to escape. Michael decides to make a deal with FIB
  <br>agent Dave Northon, according to which Michael is declared dead (Brad is buried instead) and Dave receives
  <br>credit for his killing.
