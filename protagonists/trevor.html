<p>Trevor Philips is one of the three main characters in GTA V. He was born and
<br>raised in Canada by an abusive father and a mother who was indifferent to
<br>him. He later discovers that he is a good aviation pilot, but two days before
<br>completing his training he is discharged because of his mental stability. He
<br>later turns to the world of crime, but on his first robbery he is arrested and 
<br>taken to prison.
<br>
<br>After getting out of prison, Trevor met Micheal de Santa (another GTA V
<br>protagonist) and together they formed a criminal group. Later Trevor met Brad
<br>Snider, who also joined this criminal gang. In 2004 they organized 
<br>a bank robbery in Lundendorff, after robbing it according to their plan they
<br>would manage to get on a helicopter and escape, but actually not as hoped. In
<br>fact, they were surrounded by police, Micheal and Snider were hit 
<br>by bullets (only Snider died), so Trevor in order not to abandon his friends started to fight
<br>but after a while had to flee. Shortly afterwards there was also confirmation that Micheal was
<br>dead (but that he was not actually dead).

<br>Trevor managed to escape and return to town where he settled in the rural town of Sandy
<br>Shores, where he formed a new gang with Ron Jakowski, Wade Herbert, and Chef.
